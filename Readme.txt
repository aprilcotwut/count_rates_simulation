Argueably a pointless readme:

Usage:
spectral.xcm - Run in xpsec to simulate counts with a couple parameters varying. You will need an arf and rmf file to run this. Some are provided as an example. 
spectral.R - Run in R to develop plots and a csv file of the counts
/example - An example run of spectral.xcm and spectral.R
spectral.tcl - Solely for editting, identical to spectral.xcm except a comment noting to not use it
Additional info on use/editting within the scripts.

Author: definitely not the person that wrote all the scripts or anything
